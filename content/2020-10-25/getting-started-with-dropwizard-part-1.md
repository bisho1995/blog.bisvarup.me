## Introduction

Before starting with any project we must ask ourselves the why. Why do you want to start this project? Why is THIS the right time? For me, being a frontend developer, I always wanted to understand the world of backend, how it is done at a production level, what challenges they face and so on and so forth.

So recently I spoke about my interest to my manager and they are helping me with this interest of mine, so this was the right time for me to pick up backend.

I chose dropwizard because it is used in our company's backend so I chose dropwizard and not spring/spring boot.
