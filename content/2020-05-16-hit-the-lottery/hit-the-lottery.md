The problem states you have n rupee and have a1, a2, a3 ... denominations

## Concept

The thing I liked about this problem is representation. We can represent the problem in this mathematical way.

```
a1*x1 + a2*x2 + a3*x3 + .... + am*xm = n
```

We already have `a1`, `a2`,...
we need to find  Summation (`x1` to `xm`)
