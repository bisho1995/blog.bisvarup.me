# Silly me and my dear friend jenkins

So, for work we have two Jenkins jobs, one is the actual building and the other is deploying.

So here I am done building the job and trying to check my changes and cannot find them. I am like wtf, what is this strange bug? Turns out I forgot to deploy my changes to the severe. Damn!! ðŸ˜‚
